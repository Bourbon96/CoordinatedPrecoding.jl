# CoordinatedPrecoding.jl
CoordinatedPrecoding.jl is a [Julia][julia] package for the simulation of
wireless networks, in particular multicell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
networks operating using [coordinated precoding][PracticalTDD].

The main purpose of the package is to provide an infrastructure for researchers
to write their own simulation scripts. In addition to this, the package contains
some basic network/channel models (inspired by 3GPP and ITU-T) and some
reference implementations of popular precoding methods.

The package is under continuous development, and may be improved and extended
in the future.

## Overview

### Networks
The networks are subtypes of the `Network` abstract type. In order to generate
the network, several concrete models are available:

* `InterferingBroadcastChannel`, a network without large-scale fading which
  can be used to simulate interfering broadcast channels
  (including interference channels).
* `TriangularMacroNetwork`, a triangular macro network with three sites.
  Large-scale parameters are inspired by 3GPP Case 1.
* `TriangularHetNet`, similar to the network above, but including a variable
  number of pico base stations per cell.
* `IndoorsNetwork`, an office corridor inspired by ITU-T InH
* `RandomLargeScaleNetwork`, a macro network with random base station placement
  and 3GPP inspired pathloss.

For each network, a convenience function is available for quick generation, e.g.:
`setup_interfering_broadcast_channel(num_BSs, num_MSs_per_cell, num_MS_antennas, num_BS_antennas; kwargs)`

### Simulation functions
The simulation is a simple Monte Carlo loop. Given a network, the
`simulate(network, simulation_params)` function determines large-scale
parameters by dropping the users by calling `draw_user_drop!(network)`. The
small-scale fading is then generated by calling `channel = draw_channel(network)`.
By writing customized methods for these functions, new network models can be
implemented.

The simulation function sweeps one main independent variable, but support
also exists for sweeping auxiliary independent variables.

### Reference implementations of precoding schemes
We provide implementations for the following precoding methods:

* `Shi2011_WMMSE`, the famous WMMSE algorithm by [Shi et al.][Shi2011]
* `Razaviyayn2013_MinMaxWMMSE`, min-max version of the WMMSE algorithm by
  [Razaviyayn et al.][Razaviyayn2013]
* `Komulainen2013_WMMSE`, diagonalized WMMSE algorithm by
  [Komulainen et al.][Komulainen2013]
* `Gomadam2008_MinWLI`, leakage minimization by [Gomadam et al.][Gomadam2008]
* `Gomadam2008_MaxSINR`, heuristic per-stream SINR maximization by
  [Gomadam et al.][Gomadam2008]
* `Eigenprecoding`, single-user optimal beamforming with/without TDMA

## Installation and Usage
The package is installed by calling `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/rasmusbrandt/CoordinatedPrecoding.jl")` from the Julia REPL. 

See the [examples](examples) folder for ideas on how to write the simulation
scripts. For implementing network models and precoding methods, see the
corresponding folders in the [src](src) directory.

The package uses [PyPlot.jl][PyPlotJL] for visualization,
[Lumberjack.jl][LumberjackJL] for logging, and
[ProgressMeter.jl][ProgressMeterJL] for showing progress during lengthy
simulation runs. The Min-Max WMMSE algorithm is implemented using
[Gurobi.jl][GurobiJL]. The package uses [Compat.jl][CompatJL] for compatibility between julia 0.3 and 0.4.
